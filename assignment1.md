# Critiquing Data Reporting

## [Failure Factories](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/5-schools-segregation/)

* I would rate the central insight a 5, as I was able to identify the reporters' central insight nearly right away. The main point is that in the past eight years, five schools in Pinnelas County's black neighborhoods have become some of the worst in the state. Though the headline "Failure Factories" may be difficult to understand without context, the subheading makes it clear what the focus is.

* There is no data visualization in this piece.

# Final Project Pitch

* The question I would like to answer is: **How does an area's political climate compare with its vaccination rate?**

* The data that may be available for this includes vaccination data from the [CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total) as well as political data from sources like the Federal Election Commission. 

* I feel this story is timely as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist in the United States, disproportionately impacting those that are unvaccinated. Since the start of the pandemic, many aspects such as masking and vaccinations have been politicized, so I'd be interested to see whether an area's poiltical climate is associated with their vaccination rate.

* The types of people I might utilize as sources include political scientists and health experts. Since we're located in D.C., it might be worth reaching out to federal organizations such as the Department of Health and Human Services.
