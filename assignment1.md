# Critiquing Data Reporting

## [Failure Factories](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/5-schools-segregation/)

### Clarity and Accuracy

* I would rate the central insight a 5, as I was able to identify the reporters' central insight nearly right away. The main point is that in the past eight years, five schools in Pinnelas County's black neighborhoods have become some of the worst in the state. Though the headline "Failure Factories" may be difficult to understand without context, the subheading makes it clear what the focus is.

* There is no data visualization in this piece.

* I would give this data a 4 for accuracy, as it was easy to comprehend, but also seemed slightly over-simplified at times. For example, the article states "Eight in 10 [students] fail reading, according to state standardized test scores." They always state the source, however, in this case, I question which "state standardized scores" the article is referring to, and I'm curious what the more specific numbers were, such as "86% of children failed reading in 2020."

### Quality

* I would rate the quality of the story a 5, as it is extremely detailed and comprehensive. The reporters clearly did extensive research and conducted several interviews to get a sufficient understanding of the situation and convey that clearly.

### Type and Color

* There were no graphics here, so type and color is not applicable.

### Creativity

* I thought the piece used engaging photos, but overall lacked other creative elements, so I would rate it a 2 for creativity. I think it could have used more graphs or other interactive elements to convey its main points. The use of images was a great way to break up each subheading, but I would have liked to see more graphics within the story. 

# Final Project Pitch

* The question I would like to answer is: **How does an area's political climate compare with its vaccination rate?**

* The data that may be available for this includes vaccination data from the [CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total) as well as political data from sources like the Federal Election Commission. 

* I feel this story is timely as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist in the United States, disproportionately impacting those that are unvaccinated. Since the start of the pandemic, many aspects such as masking and vaccinations have been politicized, so I'd be interested to see whether an area's poiltical climate is associated with their vaccination rate.

* The types of people I might utilize as sources include political scientists and health experts. Since we're located in D.C., it might be worth reaching out to federal organizations such as the Department of Health and Human Services.
